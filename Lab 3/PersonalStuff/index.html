        <h3>I spent 17 years in the Air Force, and was medically retired after a cancer diagnosis.
              At the start of my breast cancer journey, I met a group of women under the age of 50
              who also received that life-shattering news. I had the honor of representing that 
              support group in 2020 as a calendar embassador to raise money for women going through
              cancer treatment.
